# archaeologySkillCalcRunescape
Code for Runescape skill calculator wiki page. https://runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Archaeology_Hotspot#Archaeology_Hotspot_Calculator

Master branch currently supports only the one calculator page, future update will include other module functions so that individual hotspot pages can invoke the module functions and use them for calculations as well.

Note: Will clean up the code soon and add documentation to the wiki page as well as here.
